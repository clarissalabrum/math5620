**Routine Name:** XXXXXXXXXXXXX

**Author:** XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

**Language:** Java. 

XXXXXXXXXXXX

**Description/Purpose:** XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

**Input:** XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

**Output:** XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

**Usage/Example:**

The routine has two arguments needed to return the values of the precision in terms of the smallest number that can be
represented. Since the code is written in terms of a Fortran subroutine, the values of the machine machine epsilon and
the power of two that gives the machine epsilon. Due to implicit Fortran typing, the first argument is a single precision
value and the second is an integer.

      call smaceps(sval, ipow)
      print *, ipow, sval

Output from the lines above:

      24   5.96046448E-08

The first value (24) is the number of binary digits that define the machine epsilon and the second is related to the
decimal version of the same value. The number of decimal digits that can be represented is roughly eight (E-08 on the
end of the second value).
