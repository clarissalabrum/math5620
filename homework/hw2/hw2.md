# Homework 2

## Task 1

Created a class in Java that will create a tridiagonal matrix object in which you can invoke the rhs method to create the right hand side.

## Task 2

The alogorithm for solving the ellipic problem is a method called "solver" included in the TridiagMatrix class. It needs to be given the rhs array and it will return its solution.

## Task 4

Created a class FiniteDiffCoeff that will compute the coefficients for a finite difference approximation of a given derivative.

## Task 6

Elliptic equations are usually associated with steady state behaviors. They are boundary value problems where the solution is affected by all the domain values. Elliptic equations are used in things like harmonic analysis, geometry and I also found them used in studying crowd dynamics and quantum hall systems.
