# Homework 1

## Task 1

Sent the link to my Github home page in an email with the subject line Tasksheet 1.

## Task 2

Added Joe Koebbe (username: jvkoebbe) as a collaborator on my math5620 repository and mentioned the creation of the repository in the Tasksheet 1 email.

## Task 3

I will be using the Git Bash command line on windows. This was also mentioned in the Tasksheet 1 email.

## Task 4

    public class Task4 {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hey Koebbe, I am going to use java for this course.");
      }
    }

## Task 6

### Difference Quotient Approximations of Derivatives

The difference quotient approximations are commonly used to approximate dirivatives. Difference quotients allow a derivative at a specific value to be found without knowing the derivative of the function. Difference quotients can be used in many ways, for example calculators use the difference quotients to approximate the derivative at any given point. The Paul Seidel's lecture notes gives some good examples of the difference quotient being applied giving me a better idea on the topic.
