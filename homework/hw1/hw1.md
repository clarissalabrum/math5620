### Difference Quotient Approximations of Derivatives

The difference quotient approximations are commonly used to approximate dirivatives. Difference quotients allow a derivative at a specific value to be found without knowing the derivative of the function. Difference quotients can be used in many ways, for example calculators use the difference quotients to approximate the derivative at any given point. The Paul Seidel's lecture notes gives some good examples of the difference quotient being applied giving me a better idea on the topic.
